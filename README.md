# Laravel gRPC Validation

A Laravel package for gRPC validation inspired by [friendsofhyperf/grpc-validation](https://github.com/friendsofhyperf/grpc-validation). This package provides a seamless way to validate gRPC requests in Laravel applications using Attributes.

## Features

- **Attribute-based Validation**: Utilize PHP Attributes to define validation rules directly on your gRPC service methods.
- **Flexible Rule Definition**: Supports passing validation rules as an array or using a Laravel `FormRequest` class for more complex validation logic.
- **PHP Compatibility**: Designed to work with PHP 8.0 and above, ensuring modern PHP features and compatibility.
- **Strict Standards**: Adheres to PSR standards and passes PHPStan at the strictest level for robust code quality.
- **Unit Tested**: Comprehensive unit tests are included to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- **Final Classes and Strict Types**: Uses `final` classes and strict type declarations for better code integrity and predictability.
